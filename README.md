## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
WurstScript is an imperative, object-oriented, statically-typed, beginner-friendly programming language. Syntax and vocabulary were designed with Jass in mind, the scripting language of Warcraft III. The scope of Wurst is to compile itself in Jass to be used in Wacraft III.

This project is for adapting myself to Wurstlang because I would love to develop new maps in Wacraft3 (the game of my childhood). This is my first attempt to adjust myself to this new language. 

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have java installed, at least 1.8.0_xxx (xxx) is higher than 101. Follow the steps in http://wurstlang.org/start.html. 

```
> java -version
java version "1.8.0_131"
> git clone https://github.com/rzaharia/UnitAbilitiesWarcraft3
```

### Installing

Follow http://wurstlang.org/start.html#install-wurstscript.


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

To create tests follow http://wurstlang.org/manual.html#automated-unit-tests.

### And coding style tests

- [Wurst](http://wurstlang.org/) - Actual language used for scripting

## ✍️ Authors <a name = "authors"></a>

- [@rzaharia](https://github.com/rzaharia) - Idea & Initial work

## 🎉 Acknowledgements <a name = "acknowledgement"></a>

- I have a lot of help from people who are also creating content with this language.
- My inspiration comes from those people and from my inner wish to develop maps that could inspire other people to create content, to become more active.
